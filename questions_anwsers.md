## What's \_\_name\_\_ and \_\_main\_\_ ?

When a Python interpreter reads a Python file, it first sets a few special variables. Then it executes the code from the file.  

Python files are called modules and they are identified by the .py file extension. A module can define functions, classes, and variables.  

So when the interpreter runs a module, the ```__name__``` variable will be set as  ```__main__``` if the module that is being run is the main program.  

But if the code is importing the module from another module, then the ```__name__```  variable will be set to that moduleâ€™s name.  

```python
# Python file one module

print("File one __name__ is set to: {}" .format(__name__))
```
<p align="center">
  file_one.py
</p>

By running this file you will see exactly what we were talking about. The variable ```__name__``` for this module is set to ```__main__```:

```python
File one __name__ is set to: __main__
```

Now add another file named file_two.py and paste this code inside

```python
# Python module to import

print("File two __name__ is set to: {}" .format(__name__))
```
<p align="center">
  file_two.py
</p>

Also, modify the code in file_one.py like this so we import the file_two module:

```python
# Python module to execute
import file_two

print("File one __name__ is set to: {}" .format(__name__))
```

<p align="center">
  file_one.py
</p>

The result should look like this:

```python
File two __name__ is set to: file_two
File one __name__ is set to: __main__
```

But run file_two directly and you will see that its name is set to ```__main__```:

```python
File two __name__ is set to: __main__
```

The variable ```__name__``` for the file/module that is run will be always ```__main__```. But the ```__name__``` variable for all other modules that are being imported will be set to their module's name.

**Conclusion**

There is a really nice use case for the ```__name__``` variable, whether you want a file that can be run as the main program or imported by other modules. We can use an if ```__name__ == "__main__"``` block to allow or prevent parts of code from being run when the modules are imported.

When the Python interpreter reads a file, the ```__name__``` variable is set as ```__main__``` if the module being run, or as the module's name if it is imported. Reading the file executes all top level code, but not functions and classes (since they will only get imported).
